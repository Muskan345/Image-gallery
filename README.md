# Image-gallery
The Image Gallery Project is a web application designed to showcase a collection of images in an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly manner. The project utilizes HTML for the structure of the webpage and CSS for styling and layout. This project serves as a great example for beginners to understand how to create and style a simple yet functional web page.
Technologies Used
HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the standard markup language used to create the structure of web pages. In this project, HTML is used to define the elements of the image gallery, including the container, individual images, and any accompanying text or metadata.
Key HTML Features Used:
Semantic Elements: Use of elements like <header>, <footer>, <section>, and <article> to structure the content.
Image Embedding: Use of the <img> tag to embed images within the gallery.
Links and Navigation: Use of <a> tags for navigation and linking to other resources or pages.
Lists and Grid Layouts: Use of <ul>, <ol>, and <div> elements to organize the images in a structured layout.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used to control the presentation, formatting, and layout of the HTML elements. In this project, CSS is employed to style the image gallery, ensuring it is visually appealing and responsive across different devices.
Key CSS Features Used:
Flexbox and Grid Layouts: To create flexible and responsive layouts that adapt to various screen sizes.
Styling Elements: Use of properties like color, background, border, padding, margin, and font to enhance the visual appeal.
Responsive Design: Use of media queries to ensure the gallery looks good on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.
Hover Effects: Use of :hover pseudo-class to create interactive and dynamic effects when users interact with the images.
Transitions and Animations: To add smooth animations and transitions that enhance the user experience.
